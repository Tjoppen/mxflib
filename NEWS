Release Notes for mxflib version 1.0.0-Beta-RC4
===============================================

This is the fourth release candidate for version 1.0.0

Please note that it is expected that applications using MXFLib, or reusing a significantly amount of the code, include an acknowledgment with all copyright messages.

Things to check in code currently using mxflib 0.6.0:
* Ensure that you use dict.xml rather than types.xml and xmldict.xml
* Check that size_t is used for sizes of any memory chunks that may be larger that 4Gb. Take special care if you currently cast to or from a 32-bit type.
* Change any calls to AddTraitsMapping to include a sample instance rather than using the template format
* If you have defined any MDTraits, change methods to use size_t where required
* Where possible use the type ULs rather than type names in library calls (this ensures long-term code stability as the ULs are normative, not the names)
* Use MakeRef in preference to MakeLink
* If you have added any EssenceSubParser classes you need to do the following:
** Ensure that GetEssenceData does not increment the current position, it is safest to cache the result until the next Read or GetEssenceData call
** Change GetEssenceDataSize(), GetEssenceData() to use size_t
** Change GetEssenceSource() to return an EssenceSourcePtr
** Change IdentifyEssence() to add EssenceStreamDescriptorPtrs to the returned EssenceStreamDescriptorList rather than EssenceStreamDescriptors
** Optionally add a parser name with GetParserName() and name each wrapping with WrappingOption::Name
** Optionally add identify each wrapping with WrappingOption::WrappingID


Changes since version 1.0.0-Beta-RC3
====================================

* Updated all essence parsers that could clip-wrap huge quantities of data to ensure memory is not burst


Changes since version 1.0.0-Beta-RC2
====================================

* Add a "feature" to allow -ve index positions for pre-charge essence, if not set all index tables will start at zero
* Update dictconvert project to convert enumerations
* Add all final 382M properties of WaveAudioDescriptor in dict.xml
* Ensure that compile-time dictionary parsing matches the output from the updated dictconvert
* Add support in essence parsers and mxfwrap for interleaved streams described by a multiple descriptor
* Ensure AnchorOffset is -ve for MPEG streams


Changes since version 1.0.0-Beta-RC1
====================================

* Include VC7 project files
* Added simplewrap project for demonstrating a basic wrap utility (mxfwrap is useful, but complex!)
* Use smart pointers to EssenceSources in the write queue to prevent them being freed before all data is written
* Set Essence Container label in Descripto within the library when selecting wrapping options
* Allow "" to be taken as the current directory in SearchPath
* Ensure that BER lengths correctly use 8-byte format when clip-wrapping
* Add Platform details to Ident set
* Allow mxfcrypt to generate a key-file if none given
* Add check dump mode to mxfdump to allow automated checks that don't rely on specific property values
* Added more detailed debug to the MDTraits stub methods


Changes since version 0.6.0-Beta
================================

Changes:
This release adds the following new features:
* The mxf2dot utility for producing diagrams of mxf metadata, submitted by Philip de Nier of BBC R&D - thanks
* Enumerated value types in the types dictionary format
* The ability to specify ULs and UUIDs in various urn: formats in the dictionary, and in calls to SetString
* Type ULs in the dictionary format
* The ability to set relative write ordering of essence streams (e.g. before all the video, or after all the audio)
* Support for essence parsers that produce sub-streams
* EssenceSubParserFactory super-class to allow sub parsers to be built without requiring an instance of each parser
* Support for essence pre-charge, where supported by the source
* Static methodss on the EssenceParser class to select sub parsers and perform related essence identification functions
* Options to preserve, or recalculate, index tables in mxfcrypt
* Partition::FindLinkParent() which locates the source of a strongly referenced set in the current metadata
* UL::Matches() to test a UL against another UL, ignoring version byte
* VBI source for writing SMPTE 436M format VBI data

Bug fixes:
* Fixed a memory leak in (rarely used) EssenceSubParser::Write()
* Fixed error in parsing some JP2K headers
* Fixed problem with calculation CurrentPosition in some non-constant frame-sized sequences in wave audio
* Ensure that times are stored in UTC
* Update the Essence UL in the Descriptor in mxfcrypt

Other changes:
* Removed the redundant types.xml and xmldict.xml files
* Memory chunk sizes use size_t where there is a possibility that they may need to be larger that 4Gb, platfrom permitting
* The format of the AddTraitsMapping function changed to be safer with a range of compilers
* Moved EssenceSubParser linking into new file esp.cpp, this improves compilation speed
* Improved the handling of current position pointer and wrapping unit size in EssenseSubParsers - now only Read, and its caller GetEssenceData, move the pointer, multiple calls to GeetEssenceDataSize return a cached value
* Ensure that skipped items are witten as zero length in interleaved content packages
* Improve the usage of version-less UL compares (e.g. MDObject::IsA ignores version byte in SMPTE ULs)
* Renamed MDObject::MakeLink to MDObject::MakeRef to avoid confusion with similarly names metadata methods (old version still exists, but is deprecated)
