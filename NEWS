Release Notes for mxflib version 0.5-Beta
=========================================

Maintenance release - mainly updates of encrypted KLV processing


Changes since version 0.5.0-Beta
================================

* Split encryption code from mxfcrypt.cpp into separate crypto_asdcp files
* Added HMAC calculation and checking for encrypted KLVs
* Updated encrypted KLV key
* Fixed possible casting problem with some 64-bit values
* Allow KLVObject ReadHandlers to use a separate read buffer
* Fix incorrect IndexSID value when re-writing a partition
* Add UNUSED_PARAMETER macro
* Remove waveheader.h from mxflib.h (it is not really an mxflib item) - only now used by mxfsplit
* Add Partition::IsComplete and Partition::IsClosed
* Remove extra body partition in OP-Atom when wrapping with VBR essence


Changes since version 0.4.0-Alpha
=================================
* To be completed...

Changes since version 0.3.2-Alpha
=================================

* Added kludge code to allow compilation under gcc 3.3.x which has a known bug with complex template classes and forward declares
* Removed dependency on KLVLib by adding new dictionary loading code
* GetDict() No longer exists - replaced with various accessors
* Made MDObject::TypeUL protected with GetTypeUL() accessor
* Made MDObject::ValueType protected with GetValueType() accessor
* Made MDObject::ChildOrder protected with GetChildOrder() accessor
* Made MDType::EffectiveClass() and MDType::EffectiveType() const funcs
* Make DataChunk::Set(), DataChunk::Append() and MXFFile::Write() take const references not normal refs
* Added "RAW" data type to types.xml rather than hard-coding
* Changed "TimeStamp" data type to "Timestamp" as per SMPTE-377M
* Fixed bug where IndexManager destructor was badly wrong!
* BugFix: Change KLVFile to FileHandle in mxffile.h
* Added IndexManager class to support complex index table building
* Added many index table options to mxfwrap
* Moved index writing into MXFFile functions WritePartitionWithIndex()
* Fixed problem where HeaderByteSize was wrong in the footer
  if KAGSize > 1 and IndexByteCount > 0
* Corrected AnchorOffset in MPEG index tables
* Corrected Operational Pattern qualifiers in mxfwrap

Changes since version 0.3.1-Alpha
=================================

* Ported to Linux (x86, AMD64, Alpha, StrongARM), FreeBSD (x86), MacOS X 10.2 (PowerPC), Solaris (SPARC) and IRIX (MIPS)
* Ported to ISO C++ compilers including GCC 3.2 (not yet GCC 3.3.x - see README), MIPSpro C++ 7.3, Sun Forte C++ 5.4, Intel C++ 7.0, Borland C++ 5.0
* For portability, FileSeek() and FileSeekEnd() no longer return the current file position, only a value indicating success or failure.  Use a subsequent FileTell() to get the file position.
* Change to include path.  Now all includes are of the form <mxflib/mxflib.h> to avoid clobbering system includes during installation.
* Clip wrapping works.  Tested with MPEG-2 and DV essence.
* Fixed crash when looking up index tables with more than 2979 edit units
* Fixed index entry corruption when writing index tables for essence size >2GB
* Fixed minor crashes and unintended behaviours discovered on other platforms
* Removed '/' as option character in mxfwrap, mxftest. Use '-' instead.
* Code cleanups for gcc, icc and other compilers' warnings


Changes since version 0.3-Alpha
===============================

* Fixed "silly" bug in integer traits on big-endian platforms!
* Fixed bug in parsing MPEG headers where LoadIntra and LoadNonIntra
  were 1 bit out of place.
* Essence parsing is now performed in special EssenceParser classes
* Project mpegwrap has been replaced by project mxfwrap
* Static local variables in functions have been removed or made const
  to make thread-safety easier


Changes since version 0.2.2-Alpha
=================================

* Fixed "silly" bug in PutIxx() which only wrote 1 byte!
* Fixed a problem where sparse index table lookups didn't work
* Added Higher level objects (Package, Track etc.)
* Added ObjectInterface to allow pseudo derived types
* Fixed problem with ScanRIP in very small files with 
  FooterPartition==0 in header
* Revised Partition so it is no longer derived from MDObject
* Added WriteObject()
* Fixed problem where BuildRIP failed if all that was in the file 
  was a singe partition pack
* Fixed a bug where batches of 0 items were incorrectly read


Changes since version 0.2.1-Alpha
=================================

* Fixed problem where mxffile::Seek() returned the wrong value in 
  files with a run-in
* Revised the front page of the documentation


Changes since version 0.2-Alpha
===============================

* New child value access functions added to MDObject, with (optional)
  default values for missing children.
* MDObject is now derived from MDObjectNamedList which contains all
  children, rather than containing a property which lists children
* Added "fudge" code to deal with arrays that are not the last item
  in a "fixed length" pack.
* Fixed bug in reading arrays with > 1 type per entry, they were
  erroneously read in alphabetical order!
* Fixed bug where MDOTypes where added to ChildOrder twice
* Index tables now working, though not very efficient loading


Changes since version 0.1-Alpha
===============================

* Each MDObject stores information about where it came from which can be
  read using functions Location() and Source()
* Code now handles differences in HeaderByteCount between version 10 and 
  version 11a.
* Rational and TimeStamp compounds have their own traits
* Various minor bugs cleaned up
