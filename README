README for MXFlib
=================

MXFlib is a C++ library providing support for the MXF file format.
Included wih the library are a number of simple example applications.

MXFlib is released under the zlib license.  See the file "license.txt"
for full details.


Documentation
=============

HTML documentation on the MXFlib library internals is generated using doxygen
from source code (see docs/mxflib.dox).  If your installation did not come
with the HTML documentation, you can build it if you have doxygen installed:
  dox.bat (MS Windows)
  make    (GNU/Linux, Unix)


Compilation from source code
============================

Building using MSVC++ under MS Windows:
  Open build/msvc/mxflib.dsw
  Build the "all" project.

Building on GNU/Linux and Unix platforms:
  ./configure && make

    If building directly from CVS you must run ./bootstrap.sh first to
    generate the ./configure script.


Testing MXFlib
==============

Always run "make check" after building MXFlib which runs the testsuite.
Please report any errors to the maintainers (see AUTHORS file).

A sample MXF file is provided for testing in tests/sample_wav.mxf which you
can dump using mxfdump:
    mxfdump tests/sample_wav.mxf

Other example usage includes:
  Wrap an MPEG-2 Elementary stream file:
    mxfwrap/mxfwrap -a -f -i sample.m2v sample.mxf


Portability Issues
==================

- UUID generation functions
    At present, MXFlib uses a native UUID generator on the following
	platforms:
	  MS Windows - CoCreateGuid()
	  GNU/Linux  - uuid_generate() via the e2fsprogs library.

	A simple random number based UUID generator function is provided
	for all other platforms. This meets the requirements of	SMPTE 330M,
	however you may wish to add alternative support for your platform
	in mxflib/system.h.
