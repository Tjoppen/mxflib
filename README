README for MXFLib
=================

MXFLib is a C++ library providing support for the MXF file format.
Included wih the library are a number of simple example applications.

MXFLib is released under the zlib license.  See the file "license.txt"
for full details.


Documentation
=============

HTML documentation on the MXFLib library internals is generated using doxygen
from the source code and released as a separate file on sourceforge such as
mxflib-alpha0_3_1-docs.zip.  You can also build the documentation using:
  make (GNU/Linux, Unix)        dox.bat (MS Windows)


Compilation from source code
============================


Building using MSVC++ under MS Windows:
  Open build/msvc/mxflib.dsw
  Build the all project.

Building on GNU/Linux and Unix platforms:
  ./configure && make

  If building from a CVS working copy you must run ./bootstrap.sh first
  to generate the configure script.


Testing MXFLib
==============

Always run "make check" after building MXFlib which runs the testsuite.
Please report any errors to the maintainers.

A sample MXF file is provided for testing in tests/sample_wav.mxf which you
can dump using mxfdump:
    mxfdump tests/sample_wav.mxf

Other example usage includes:
  Wrap an MPEG-2 Elementary stream file:
    mxfwrap/mxfwrap -a -f -i sample.m2v sample.mxf


Portability Issues
==================

- Your platform must have a UUID generation function
    MS Windows provides CoCreateGuid().  On GNU/Linux the e2fsprogs library
    provides uuid_generate().  Only these two functions are supported in
    mxflib/system.h - if your platform provides a different function you
    will need to add support for it in mxflib/system.h.

- MXFLib requires an ISO C99 and ISO C++ (1998) compliant compiler (except
  for MSVC++)
    Solaris 7, 8 and 9 do not ship with an ISO C99 conforming freestanding
    implementation.  Notably /usr/include/stdint.h is missing.

    A quick fix is to (in the mxflib source directory):
      sed 's/^#pragma ident.*//' /usr/include/sys/inttypes.h > stdint.h

    A longer fix is to install glibc 2.3 and GCC 3.2.
